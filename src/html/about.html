        <h2>About me</h2>
        <br />I am a novice front-end developer who has learned programming since the end of 2018. Currently I am looking for a possibility to gain more programming experience in Front-End. There are some values I prioritize such as self-development, broadening my competences and chance to contribute to some real projects. I am ready to get involved in learning new technologies as well as honing my current skills. I am also a person with an analytical mind who is a good team player, learns easily, likes challenges and communicates fluently in English.
