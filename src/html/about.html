        <h2>About me</h2>
        <br />I am a novice front-end developer who has learned programming since the end of 2018. Recently I have started to gain my first programming experience in Front-End. There are some values I highly prioritize such as self-development and broadening my competences. I am open to get involved in learning new technologies as well as honing my current skills. I am also a person with an analytical mind who is a good team player, but has no problem with complete tasks independently as well, llearns easily, likes challenges and communicates fluently in English.
